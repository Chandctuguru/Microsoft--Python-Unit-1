Program: adding_report() function

This program calls the adding_report() function which repeatedly takes positive integer input until the user quits and then sums the integers and prints a "report".
The adding_report() function has 1 string parameter which indicates the type of report:

"A" used as the argument to adding_report() results in printing of all of the input integers and the total
"T" used as the argument results in printing only the total

Additional Details:

initialize total variable which will sum integer values entered
initialize items variable which will build a string of the integer inputs separated with a new line character
define the adding_report function with one parameter report that will be a string with default of "T"
inside the function build a forever loop (infinite while loop) and inside the loop complete the following

use a variable to gather input (integer or "Q")
check if the input string is a digit (integer) and if it is...
add input iteger to total
if report type is "A" add the numeric character(s) to the item string seperated by a new line
if not a digit, check if the input string is "Q" or starts with a "Q", if "Q" then...
if the report type is "A" print out all the integer items entered and the sum total
if report type is "T" then print out the sum total only
break out of while loop to end the function after printing the report ("A" or "T")
if not a digit and if not a "Q" then print a message that the "input is invalid"
Call the adding_report function with "A" and then with "T" report parameters
